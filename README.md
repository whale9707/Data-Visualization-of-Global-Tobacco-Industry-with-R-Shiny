## Abstract: 

Tobacco consumption has been one of the biggest public health threats in the world. Recent studies conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation have shown that around 7.2 million people die prematurely every year from smoking. However, despite the severe harms of tobacco usage, it is impractical to simply ban tobacco production as tobacco generates significant economic benefits such as agricultural employment, tax revenue, foreign exchange earnings, etc. Therefore, policymakers in different countries need to find a balance point between the harms of tobacco consumption on public health and the economic benefits generated from the tobacco industry.

Our team aims to utilize various data visualization techniques on tobacco industry and policy datasets to see the effectiveness and public sentiment of global tobacco control policies from 2008 to 2018.

## Techniques: 

We used R shiny ggplot2, plotly, maps, text analysis (sentiment analysis, word clouds and network analysis) for data visualization.

## Product Overview:

The whole structure of our final product falls into six parts.

- **Project overview**: the main objective of the dashboard and an introduction to our team
- **Tobacco Background**: the background information about the tobacco industry from the perspective of consumption and threat to health
- **Global Tobacco Control Policy**:  detailed introduction to the tobacco control policies all over the world
- **Cost Benefit Analysis**: we developed an algorithm to do the cost benefit analysis for the tobacco industry
- **Text Exploration**:  texts from both New York Times and Reddit to see peopleâ€™s discussion around this topic
- **Appendix**: the data source for our product
